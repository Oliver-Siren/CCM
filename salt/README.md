Arctic CCM: Salt!
===================
by Jori Laine

##Hello!
In this file you’ll find the files and documentation to my [SaltStack](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html). research and my report on it.

It consists of several pretty basic state (.sls) files of my own creation that install applications and services to Linux systems and Windows OS (due to licensing [Salt Windows repository](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/windows/windows-package-manager.html) is not included, but you’ll find instructions to downloading it in Installation instructions document). 

Arctic CCM Salt section was a part of a centralized configuration management research and evaluation project that was done as a part of a Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences' course [Monialaprojekti PRO4TN001-3](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/fi/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/PRO4TN001) with the intent to learn about the four most popular CCM systems (puppet, Salt, Chef and Ansible).

It covers some of the basic functionalities of Salt and tries to offer some insite to its benefits and attributes.
