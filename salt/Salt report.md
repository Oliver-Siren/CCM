**Arctic CCM Salt: Report** *by Jori Laine*
===================

## Introduction

[Salt**Stack**](https://saltstack.com/) study is my contribution to the Arctic CCM (centralized configuration management) research and evaluation project.

It consists of several rather basic state files (.sls) of my own creation, that install applications and services to Linux systems as well as Windows OS (due to licensing [Salt Windows repository](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/windows/windows-package-manager.html) is not included, but youâ€™ll find instructions for downloading it in the ["Installation instructions"](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md) document). Also, in here you will find my Linux provisioning with PXE configuration files that I used, in order to create multiple minions on which to test my Salt configuration at the Haaga-Helia computer laboratory.

Arctic CCM Salt section was a part of a centralized configuration management research and evaluation project that was done as a part of a Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences' course [Monialaprojekti PRO4TN001-3](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/fi/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/PRO4TN001) with the intent to learn about the four most popular CCM systems: puppet, Salt, Chef and Ansible.

The documentation covers some of the basic functionalities of Salt and tries to offer some insight to its benefits and attributes.

I made many mistakes during this project and spent a lot of time knocking my head against the wall, trying to figure out how to do this or that. This is what my [original Salt report](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Origin%20(in%20finnish)/Salt%20raportti.md) (only available in Finnish) reflects and because of this, I decided to rewrite my report, in order to give it more structure and make it easier to read. I can honestly say that I have also had quite a lot of fun working on this project, this being mostly thanks to my amazing friends in the Arctic project workgroup and my family that gave me the time to work on it.

My Salt research has been used and studied for evaluating the benefits of Salt in two projects, coinciding with our own Arctic CCM project:
- A smart mirror ([Kuvastin](https://kuvastinblog.wordpress.com/)) project that being sponsored by the smartphone manufacturer OnePlus.

- The Campfire occupation monitor ([Nuotiovahti](https://raspluonto.wordpress.com/)) project that was conceived as a part of the three years long Virtual Nature development project, that is run by [Lahti University of Applied Sciences](http://www.lamk.fi/english/Sivut/default.aspx)
in partnership with [Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/frontpage), [University of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/mot) and [Karelia University of Applied Sciences](http://www.karelia.fi/en/), with the funding from The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

## The Beginning

My part in the Arctic CCM begun with the dread and excitement brought by the thought of having to study and learn to use a completely new method of centralized configuration management. I had tried out some puppet before and that was the extent of my experience with these kind of environments.

The Salt documentation had this article ["Salt in 10 minutes"](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html), which gave me the impression that Salt was going to be easy, but by the time I had my first master and minion functioning and my first test state ready, I had already spent more than 16 hours working on it. With the hindsight I can understand their 10 minute claim, for after getting to know Salt it really does seem possible to do what I did in 10 minutes.

## Salt

Salt is a toolkit above all else, to me it seems that it has a tool for everything that I would think an average system administrator could need in order to manage any network of larger than few devices. It is open-source software with a Enterprise package offering support and additional services. So unless you need support on enterprise scale, the cost of using Salt is time and effort you put in to it.

Salt is by desing a highly modular environment that allows you to pick and chose the parts you need for your network while supporting future needs and growth. According to Salt's devoloper SaltStack, Salt scales well beyond tens of thousands of servers.

I have tested Salt in a environment comprising of both Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows systems on PC and virtual machines as well as in a scenario where some of the minions are beyond the local area network that I had used but in a network only accessable through public internet.

| *Environment where some of the minions are located beyond LAN* |

To use Salt it is good to know some programming language. Salt itself uses Python and YAML as well as JSON and Jinja but in my states I only needed YAML and Python, YAML having been totally new to me before this project.

Not only can Salt master manage the devices in your network but also it can be used to monitor and gather information about those devices, that information can for example be disk usage or list of applications currently installed on minion and the version of that application. This date can later be used for targeting specific computer or a group of devices that your master controls with your state modules in your top.sls file (in many ways the top.sls file has the same function in Salt as the site.pp file has in puppet). Salt can control various devices ranging from your common OS' to network routers.

## Understanding Salt

With Salt it all starts with the top.sls file that you will have to create in to your Salt directory "/srv/salt/" which is the default directory from where your Salt master will start looking for instructions. For installing Salt and getting started with master-minion structure you can read my instructions [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md).

### Targeting with Salt

| ![Dia8.png](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/Dia8.png) | 
|:--:|
| *Rudimentary top.sls file* |

I used in my top.sls file the names of my minions as a way to target them with state instructions, but if you should have a larger network of devices you should concider some alternate targeting date to control groups instead of having to type each and every device's host name to your top.sls

With the Pillar structure you can store static date like information about your minions and organize them in to groups for easier targeting management, unfortunately I did not have the time to try this system too thoroughly myself but I do think it is something worth looking in to as the need arises.

| ![pillardata.PNG](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/pillardata.PNG) | 
|:--:|
| *Example of the pillar static data* |

Picture above presents the way you can insert static data to your pillar, in this picture you see instructions to command to install apache and vim and what they mean for different operating systems.

## State instructions

In order for top.sls to do anything, it needs to have state files to run. You can always just run one-liners to execute commands through Salt, but organizing your instructions in to reusable state files makes network management just so much easier.

| ![Dia9.png](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/Dia9.PNG) | 
|:--:|
| *Simple one-liner command* |

You can build your state files how every you wish but Salt seems to execute them from top to bottom by default. Like in puppet you can set conditions to execution, conditions like for one part of the .sls file to be executed before other. As these state files are writen in YAML they are very particular about the use of empty space, you should always use Space instead of Tab and each indent requires two spaces first line being indented with one space.

```
 install_lamp:
   pkg.installed:
     - pkgs:
       - apache2
       - libapache2-mod-php

 /var/www/html/index.php:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://webserver/index.php
    - require:
      - pkg: install_lamp

 /var/www/html/index.html:
  file:
    - absent
    - require:
      - pkg: install_lamp 
```

Above you see half of my LAMP-stack install instructions with the apache default page (/var/www/html/) at localhost replaced with my own php test site. For the second half where I istalled MySQL I found it difficult to do for I had to somehow manage to insert root passwords before installation as Salt does an silent install of it.

I had some luck with it for I found an article by [Tero Karvinen](http://terokarvinen.com/) that had the [instructions](http://terokarvinen.com/2015/preseed-mysql-server-password-with-salt-stack) on how to preseed passwords with Salt.

## Adding users to Ubuntu

Same kind of problem came with adding users to minions where I had to give usernames and passwords.

```
 opiskelija:
   user.present:
     - fullname: opiskelija
     - shell: /bin/bash
     - home: /home/opiskelija
     - password: $6$7o5/CdYSAA9nKCSc$RfBbK6WDmJYdw/BeytFj8nyPWBEJJwenIPxZsgpk4IZMPVNDh5ZXe4WhqYcaMWR4XG0fjPT7ANuBfybOieN1/0
     - enforce_password: True
```
So that every users password wouldnt be readily available to anyone who had access to these files and to make sure password was transfered securely, I decided to not put them in plain text format. For encypting the passwords and adding users I found this handy post https://gist.github.com/UtahDave/3785738 and for encryption I found a comment by user [me-vlad](https://gist.github.com/me-vlad) that had the following:

`python -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('password', crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))"`

On my master this though this didn't work immediately and I had to install python first.

This line was the one I used in the end.

`python3.5 -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('password', crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))"`


## Setting up firewall

For setting firewall port rules I went and traight out modified the /etc/ufw/user6.rules and /etc/ufw/user.rules files and used them as templates, and for activating UFW I took a look at the [Pat McNally's](https://github.com/patmcnally) instructions that you can find [here](https://github.com/patmcnally/salt-states-webapps/blob/master/firewall/ufw.sls).

```
 ufw:
   pkg.installed

 /etc/ufw/user.rules:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://firewall/user.rules
    - require:
      - pkg: ufw

 /etc/ufw/user6.rules:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://firewall/user6.rules
    - require:
      - pkg: ufw

 ufw-enable:
   cmd.run:
     - name: 'ufw --force enable'
     - require:
       - pkg: ufw
```

## Salt on Windows

I only had the opportunity to try Salt on Windows 10 Pro version, and my instructions to installing Salt on Windows you can find [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md). Windows system can only work as a minion to a master and not be a master itself.

Salt for Windows works in a same way as with Linux, the only major that I ran in to being the fact that Windows does not have its own package repository, but SaltStack does have one such repository for Windows. This only had to be downloaded on the master and then seeded to the Windows minions. This repository is basicly a list of applications and instructions on where to download them from and how to install as well as uninstall them.

```
 install_windows:
   pkg.installed:
     - pkgs:
       - firefox
       - libreoffice
```

You can also make your own instructions and add them to your repository for Windows, but I never succeeded in getting my own instructions to work properly.

The failed download and install instruction in /srv/salt/win/repo/salt-winrepo/

```
battlenet:
  '1.9':
    full_name: 'Battle.net'
    installer: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    install_flags: '/S'
    uninstaller: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    msiexec: False
    locale: en_US
    reboot: False
```
Since I never got the install part of it to work, I also never tested if my uninstall instructions would have worked.
/srv/salt/win/repo-ng/salt-winrepo-ng/

```
# just 32-bit x86 installer available
{% if grains['cpuarch'] == 'AMD64' %}
    {% set PROGRAM_FILES = "%ProgramFiles(x86)%" %}
{% else %}
    {% set PROGRAM_FILES = "%ProgramFiles%" %}
{% endif %}
battlenet:
  '1.9':
    full_name: 'Battle.net'
    installer: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    install_flags: '/S'
    uninstaller: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    msiexec: False
    locale: en_US
    reboot: False
```
The command `sudo salt 'WinMin' pkg.install 'battlenet'` yielded scarce results, as only thing Salt managed to do was get stuck, or so I first thought. Closer examination of my Windows minion showed that in the Windows Task Manager there actually was a Battlenet Setup.exe running and there was a battle.net-Setup.exe package to be found in the Salt directory on my Windows minion.

But as I earlier stated, my experiment ended in failure, and the reason for that in my opinion was that i did not manage to find the correct install_flags for installing this package and thus the reason for why i could see the program running but it never got compleated was that the install was waiting for user input.

Should you want to try doing your own install instruction state file, I think you might want to learn about the possible flags, so here is the result of my attempt to look in to them

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367988(v=vs.85).aspx

### Adding users to Windows

Probably you'll want to use AD ([Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory)) to manage your users, but I used Salt for adding users:

```
 CreateUser:
   user.present:
    - name: opiskelija
    - fullname: opiskelija
    - password: 'salainen'
    - groups:
      - Administrators
```

As you can see the password is in plain text format for I did not have the time to figure out how to get it through encrypted to Windows.

### Changing the defaul wallpaper on Windows

Windows default wallpaper is stored in C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg but you do not own nor do you have the rights to this file on default. So first thing that you have to do is take ownership and asign rights to it to Administrators group.

For this I created a Powershell script that does this

```
if (!([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) { Start-Process powershell.exe "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs; exit }

takeown /f C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg
icacls C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg /Grant 'Administrators:(F)'
Remove-Item c:\windows\WEB\wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg
Copy-Item C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\4k\img0.jpg C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg
```
This script has worked for me and you'll find instructions on how to get it to work [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md#installing-windows-minions).

After this all that is needed it a simple state instruction file that first moves this powershell script to the minion and then runs it.

```
 C:\Replacewallpaper.ps1:
   file:
     - managed
     - source: salt://ReplaceWallpaper.ps1
 
 Run myscript:
   cmd:
     - run
     - name: C:\ReplaceWallpaper.ps1
     - shell: powershell
```
At this point I had the rights to the img0.jpg and it was a matter of replacing the image.


```
 C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\4K:
   file:
     - directory
     - makedirs: True
     - source: salt://replacewallpaper/4K

 C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\4K\img0.jpg:
   file:
     - managed
     - source: salt://replacewallpaper/4K/img0.jpg
```
