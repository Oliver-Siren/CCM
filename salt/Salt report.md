**Arctic CCM Salt: Report** *by Jori Laine*
===================

## Introduction

Salt**Stack** study is my contribution to the Arctic CCM (centralized configuration management) research and evaluation project.

It consists of several rather basic state files (.sls) of my own creation, that install applications and services to Linux systems as well as Windows OS (due to licensing [Salt Windows repository](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/windows/windows-package-manager.html) is not included, but youâ€™ll find instructions for downloading it in the ["Installation instructions"](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md) document). Also, in here you will find my Linux provisioning with PXE configuration files that I used, in order to create multiple minions on which to test my Salt configuration at the Haaga-Helia computer laboratory.

Arctic CCM Salt section was a part of a centralized configuration management research and evaluation project that was done as a part of a Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences' course [Monialaprojekti PRO4TN001-3](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/fi/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/PRO4TN001) with the intent to learn about the four most popular CCM systems: puppet, Salt, Chef and Ansible.

The documentation covers some of the basic functionalities of Salt and tries to offer some insight to its benefits and attributes.

I made many mistakes during this project and spent a lot of time knocking my head against the wall, trying to figure out how to do this or that. This is what my [original Salt report](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Origin%20(in%20finnish)/Salt%20raportti.md) (only available in Finnish) reflects and because of this, I decided to rewrite my report, in order to give it more structure and make it easier to read. I can honestly say that I have also had quite a lot of fun working on this project, this being mostly thanks to my amazing friends in the Arctic project workgroup and my family that gave me the time to work on it.

My Salt research has been used and studied for evaluating the benefits of Salt in two projects, coinciding with our own Arctic CCM project:
- A smart mirror ([Kuvastin](https://kuvastinblog.wordpress.com/)) project that being sponsored by the smartphone manufacturer OnePlus.

- The Campfire occupation monitor ([Nuotiovahti](https://raspluonto.wordpress.com/)) project that was conceived as a part of the three years long Virtual Nature development project, that is run by [Lahti University of Applied Sciences](http://www.lamk.fi/english/Sivut/default.aspx)
in partnership with [Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/frontpage), [University of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/mot) and [Karelia University of Applied Sciences](http://www.karelia.fi/en/), with the funding from The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

## The Beginning

My part in the Arctic CCM begun with the dread and excitement brought by the thought of having to study and learn to use a completely new method of centralized configuration management. I had tried out some puppet before and that was the extent of my experience with these kind of environments.

The Salt documentation had this article ["Salt in 10 minutes"](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html), which gave me the impression that Salt was going to be easy, but by the time I had my first master and minion functioning and my first test state ready, I had already spent more than 16 hours working on it. With the hindsight I can understand their 10 minute claim, for after getting to know Salt it really does seem possible to do what I did in 10 minutes.

## Salt

Salt is a toolkit above all else, to me it seems that it has a tool for everything that I would think an average
