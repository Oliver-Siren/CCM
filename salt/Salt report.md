**Arctic CCM Salt: Report** *by Jori Laine*
===================

## Introduction

[Salt**Stack**](https://saltstack.com/) study is my contribution to the Arctic CCM (centralized configuration management) research and evaluation project.

It consists of several rather basic state files (.sls) of my own creation, that install applications and services to Linux systems, as well as Windows OS (due to licensing [Salt Windows repository](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/windows/windows-package-manager.html) is not included, but youâ€™ll find the instructions for downloading it in the ["Installation instructions"](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md) document). Also, in here you will find my Linux provisioning with PXE configuration files that I used, in order to create multiple minions on which to test my Salt configuration at the Haaga-Helia computer laboratory.

Arctic CCM Salt section was a part of a centralized configuration management research and evaluation project that was done as a part of a Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences' course [Monialaprojekti PRO4TN001-3](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/fi/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/PRO4TN001), with the intent to learn about the four most popular CCM systems: puppet, Salt, Chef and Ansible.

The documentation covers some of the basic functionalities of Salt and tries to offer some insight to its benefits and attributes.

I made many mistakes during this project and spent a lot of time knocking my head against the wall, trying to figure out how to do this or that. This is what my [original Salt report](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Origin%20(in%20finnish)/Salt%20raportti.md) (only available in Finnish) reflects and because of this, I decided to rewrite my report, in order to give it more structure and make it easier to read. I can honestly say that I have also had quite a lot of fun working on this project, this being mostly thanks to my amazing friends in the Arctic project workgroup and my family that gave me the time to work on it.

My Salt research has been used and studied for evaluating the benefits of Salt in two projects, coinciding with our own Arctic CCM project:
- A smart mirror ([Kuvastin](https://kuvastinblog.wordpress.com/)) project that was sponsored by the smartphone manufacturer OnePlus.

- The Campfire occupation monitor ([Nuotiovahti](https://raspluonto.wordpress.com/)) project that was conceived as a part of the three-year-long Virtual Nature development project, that is run by [Lahti University of Applied Sciences](http://www.lamk.fi/english/Sivut/default.aspx)
in partnership with [Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/frontpage), [University of Eastern Finland](http://www.uef.fi/en/web/mot) and [Karelia University of Applied Sciences](http://www.karelia.fi/en/), with the funding from The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

## The Beginning

My part in the Arctic CCM began with the dread and excitement brought by the thought of having to study and learn to use a completely new method of centralized configuration management. I had tried out some puppet before and that was the extent of my experience with this kind of environments.

The Salt documentation had this article ["Salt in 10 minutes"](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html), which gave me the impression that Salt was going to be easy, but by the time I had my first master and minion functioning and my first test state ready, I had already spent more than 16 hours working on it. With the hindsight I can understand their 10 minute claim, for after getting to know Salt, it really does seem possible to do what I did in 10 minutes.

## Salt

Salt is a toolkit above all else, to me it seems that it has a tool for everything that I would think an average system administrator could need in order to manage any network of larger than a few devices. It is an open-source software with an Enterprise package offering support and additional services. So unless you need support on an enterprise scale, the cost of using Salt is the time and effort you put into it.

Salt is by design a highly modular environment that allows you to pick and chose the parts you need for your network, while supporting future needs and growth. According to Salt's devoloper SaltStack, Salt scales well beyond tens of thousands of servers.

Salt stands out amongst the rest of the top four centralized configuration management softwares, like puppet, Chef and Ansible, in its primary way of completing its tasks. This way is what I would call reactive architecture. Where most of the competition is based on push or pull architercture, Salt's idea is to react to events with pre-set lists of instructions. Salt documentation calls this system [Reactor](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/reactor/). These events can be a singular event, patterns of behavior in minions, or anything in between.

I have tested Salt in an environment comprising of both Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows systems on PC and virtual machines, as well as in a scenario where some of the minions are beyond the local area network that I had used but in a network only accessible through public internet.

| *Environment where some of the minions are located beyond LAN* |

In order to use Salt, it is good to know some programming language. Salt itself uses Python and YAML, as well as JSON and Jinja, but in my states I only needed YAML and Python, YAML having been totally new to me before this project.

Not only can Salt master manage the devices in your network, but it can also be used to monitor and gather information about those devices. That information can, for example, be disk usage or a list of applications currently installed on minion and the version of those applications. This data can later be used for targeting a specific computer or a group of devices that your master controls with your state modules in your top.sls file (in many ways the top.sls file has the same function in Salt as the site.pp file has in puppet). Salt can control various devices ranging from your common OS' to network routers.

## Understanding Salt

In Salt's case, it all starts with the top.sls file that you will have to create in your Salt directory "/srv/salt/", which is the default directory your Salt master will start looking for instructions from. For installing Salt and getting started with master-minion structure you can read my instructions [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md).

### Targeting with Salt

| ![Dia8.png](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/Dia8.png) | 
|:--:|
| *Rudimentary top.sls file* |

I used in my top.sls file the names of my minions as a way to target them with state instructions, but if you have a larger network of devices, then you should consider some alternate targeting data to control groups, instead of having to type each and every device's host name to your top.sls.

With the Pillar structure, you can store static data, like information about your minions and organize them into groups for easier targeting management. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to try this system too thoroughly myself, but I do think it is something worth looking into, as the need arises.

| ![pillardata.PNG](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/pillardata.PNG) | 
|:--:|
| *Example of the pillar static data* |

The picture above presents the way you can insert static data into your pillar. In this picture, you are able to see the instruction commands required to install apache and vim, as well as what they mean for different operating systems.

## State instructions

In order for top.sls to do anything, it needs to have state files to run. You can always just run one-liners to execute commands through Salt, but organizing your instructions into reusable state files makes network management much easier.

| ![Dia9.png](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/Dia9.PNG) | 
|:--:|
| *Simple one-liner command* |

You can build your state files however you wish, but Salt seems to execute them from top to bottom by default. For example, in puppet you can set conditions to execution, conditions like for one part of the .sls file to be executed before other. As these state files are writen in YAML they are very particular about the use of empty space, you should always use Space instead of Tab and each indent requires two spaces, the first line being indented with one space.

```
 install_lamp:
   pkg.installed:
     - pkgs:
       - apache2
       - libapache2-mod-php

 /var/www/html/index.php:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://webserver/index.php
    - require:
      - pkg: install_lamp

 /var/www/html/index.html:
  file:
    - absent
    - require:
      - pkg: install_lamp 
```

Above, you can see half of my LAMP-stack install instructions with the apache default page (/var/www/html/) at localhost replaced with my own php test site. For the second half when I istalled MySQL, for I had to somehow managed to insert root passwords before installation, as Salt does a silent installation of it. And as you can imagine, I found it difficult to do.

I had some luck with it, for I found an article by [Tero Karvinen](http://terokarvinen.com/) that had the [instructions](http://terokarvinen.com/2015/preseed-mysql-server-password-with-salt-stack) on how to preseed passwords with Salt.

## Adding users to Ubuntu

I have stumbled upon the same kind of problem while adding users to minions, where I had to give usernames and passwords.

```
 opiskelija:
   user.present:
     - fullname: opiskelija
     - shell: /bin/bash
     - home: /home/opiskelija
     - password: $6$7o5/CdYSAA9nKCSc$RfBbK6WDmJYdw/BeytFj8nyPWBEJJwenIPxZsgpk4IZMPVNDh5ZXe4WhqYcaMWR4XG0fjPT7ANuBfybOieN1/0
     - enforce_password: True
```
So that every user password wouldn't be readily available to anyone who had access to these files and to make sure that the password was transfered securely, I decided to not put them in plain text format. For encypting the passwords and adding users, I found this handy post https://gist.github.com/UtahDave/3785738 and for encryption I found a comment by user [me-vlad](https://gist.github.com/me-vlad) that had the following line:

`python -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('password', crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))"`

On my master, this didn't work immediately, however, and I had to install python prior to it.

This line was the one I used in the end.

`python3.5 -c "import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('password', crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))"`


## Setting up firewall

For setting firewall port rules, I went and straight-out modified the /etc/ufw/user6.rules and /etc/ufw/user.rules files and used them as templates, and for activating UFW I took a look at the [Pat McNally's](https://github.com/patmcnally) instructions that you can find [here](https://github.com/patmcnally/salt-states-webapps/blob/master/firewall/ufw.sls).

```
 ufw:
   pkg.installed

 /etc/ufw/user.rules:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://firewall/user.rules
    - require:
      - pkg: ufw

 /etc/ufw/user6.rules:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://firewall/user6.rules
    - require:
      - pkg: ufw

 ufw-enable:
   cmd.run:
     - name: 'ufw --force enable'
     - require:
       - pkg: ufw
```

## Salt on Windows

I only had the opportunity to try Salt on Windows 10 Pro version, and you can find my instructions on how to install Salt on Windows [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md). The Windows system can only work as a minion to a master and not be a master itself.

Salt for Windows works in a same way as with Linux, the only major difference that I ran into was the fact that Windows does not have its own package repository, but SaltStack does have one such repository for Windows. This only had to be downloaded on the master and then seeded to the Windows minions. This repository is basicly a list of applications and instructions on where to download them from and how to install, as well as uninstall them.

```
 install_windows:
   pkg.installed:
     - pkgs:
       - firefox
       - libreoffice
```

You can also make your own instructions and add them to your repository for Windows, but I never succeeded in getting my own instructions to work properly.

The failed download and install instructions in /srv/salt/win/repo/salt-winrepo/

```
battlenet:
  '1.9':
    full_name: 'Battle.net'
    installer: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    install_flags: '/S'
    uninstaller: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    msiexec: False
    locale: en_US
    reboot: False
```
Since I never got the install part of it to work, I never got to test if my uninstall instructions would have worked, either.
/srv/salt/win/repo-ng/salt-winrepo-ng/

```
# just 32-bit x86 installer available
{% if grains['cpuarch'] == 'AMD64' %}
    {% set PROGRAM_FILES = "%ProgramFiles(x86)%" %}
{% else %}
    {% set PROGRAM_FILES = "%ProgramFiles%" %}
{% endif %}
battlenet:
  '1.9':
    full_name: 'Battle.net'
    installer: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    install_flags: '/S'
    uninstaller: 'https://eu.battle.net/download/getInstaller?os=win&installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe'
    msiexec: False
    locale: en_US
    reboot: False
```
The command `sudo salt 'WinMin' pkg.install 'battlenet'` yielded scarce results, as the only thing Salt managed to do was getting stuck, or so I first thought. Closer examination of my Windows minion showed that in the Windows Task Manager there actually was a Battlenet Setup.exe running and there was a battle.net-Setup.exe package to be found in the Salt directory on my Windows minion.

But as I stated earlier, my experiment ended in failure, and the reason for that, in my opinion, was that I did not manage to find the correct install_flags for installing this package. Thus, the reason why I could see the program running but it never got completed was that the install was waiting for the user input.

Should you want to try creating your own install instruction state file, I think you might want to learn about the possible flags, so here is the result of my attempt to look into them:

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367988(v=vs.85).aspx

### Adding users to Windows

You'll probably want to use AD ([Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory)) to manage your users, but I used Salt for adding users:

```
 CreateUser:
   user.present:
    - name: opiskelija
    - fullname: opiskelija
    - password: 'salainen'
    - groups:
      - Administrators
```

As you can see, the password is in plain text format, for I did not have the time to figure out how to get it through encrypted to Windows.

### Changing the defaul wallpaper on Windows

Windows default wallpaper is stored in C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg, but you do not own nor do you have the rights to this file on default. So the first thing that you have to do is take ownership and assign rights to it to the Administrators group.

In order to make that happen, I created a Powershell script that does this:

```
if (!([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) { Start-Process powershell.exe "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs; exit }

takeown /f C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg
icacls C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg /Grant 'Administrators:(F)'
Remove-Item c:\windows\WEB\wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg
Copy-Item C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\4k\img0.jpg C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\img0.jpg
```
This script has worked for me. You'll find instructions on how to get it to work [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/Installation%20instructions.md#installing-windows-minions).

After this, all that is needed is a simple state instruction file that first moves this powershell script to the minion and then runs it.

```
 C:\Replacewallpaper.ps1:
   file:
     - managed
     - source: salt://ReplaceWallpaper.ps1
 
 Run myscript:
   cmd:
     - run
     - name: C:\ReplaceWallpaper.ps1
     - shell: powershell
```
At this point, I had the rights to the img0.jpg and it was all just a matter of replacing the image.


```
 C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\4K:
   file:
     - directory
     - makedirs: True
     - source: salt://replacewallpaper/4K

 C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows\4K\img0.jpg:
   file:
     - managed
     - source: salt://replacewallpaper/4K/img0.jpg
```
## PXE and installing Ubuntu

This repository contains parts and references to provisioning and installing multiple computers in Salt, puppet and Ansible documentation of our Arctic CCM project. Should you be interested, you can check out [Joona LeppÃ¤lahti's](https://joonaleppalahti.wordpress.com/) guide on this that can be found [here](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/ansible/Ansible%20raportti.md#provisiointi)(Only available in Finnish!!)

## The End

In the end of this project, I really felt like I knew my own corner of Salt, but I also acknowledge the fact that I have only been scratching the surface and there is still much to learn, as I suspect that I have not even touched the main features of Salt nor have I fully experimented with its full potential.

I had some ideas on how a large Salt network would look like:

| ![Dia5.png](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/Dia5.PNG) | 
|:--:|
| *Hierarchy stucture of masters to allow for load ballance in large network* |

| ![Dia6.png](https://github.com/joonaleppalahti/CCM/blob/master/salt/saltimg/Dia6.png) | 
|:--:|
| *Two masters with shared master key serving all minions together* |

These models could, in my opinion, help with the load balancing and would have been fun to try if I had the opportunity.

Overall, I would recommend Salt and found it to be a capable tool.

## Afterword

In my opinion, the Arctic CCM project did not reach its full potential and with a better project leadership on my part, we would have been able to do better work, but we set the bar too low in the beginning and only raised it in the end, when it was already too late to do anything to rectify this.

## What a long strange trip it has been

As of 10.12.2017 23:00 in the European way of marking the date, I have 182 hours and 15 minutes on the clock of working time on this project, I recognize that this does not make me an expert on Salt, but I hope you have found my report useful and maybe somewhat entertaining.

Thank you for reading this and Happy Holidays!
