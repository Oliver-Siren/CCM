# Arctic CCM
Arctic CCM  was a centralized configuration management research and evaluation project that was done as a part of a Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences' course [Monialaprojekti PRO4TN001-3](http://www.haaga-helia.fi/fi/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/PRO4TN001) with the intent to learn about the four most popular CCM systems: puppet, Salt, Chef and Ansible.

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to learn more about centralized management applications and also make reusable example material that can be used by anyone later on. The goal is to make examples for both Linux and Windows. The completed project includes working network enviroment thats done with centralized management applications: Ansible, Chef, Puppet and Salt.

## This github includes
We have made four folders for the four different centralized management programs that we have used. Salt and Chef are written in english and Puppet and Ansible are in finnish. Each folder includes guides on how to install each program as master and how to give commands to Linux and Windows slaves with your master. Also instructions for setting up the slaves are provided. We also have guides for provisioning slaves for use with these programs. We have also included different config files or modules that we used with these programs.
