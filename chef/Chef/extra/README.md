# Extra!

This folder contains descriptions about fixing problems that I encounter while working on the project and some additional things that relate to the project but arent directly related to Chef itself.

There are also two bash scripts that expedite installation of ChefServer and ChefDK. These might get outdated at some point. When they do visit https://downloads.chef.io/ for the latest versions.

Hopefully these tales of bug hunting are useful to you.
