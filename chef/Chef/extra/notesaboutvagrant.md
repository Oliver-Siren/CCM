I have separate vagrant folders for the same instances of vagrant here. I find working this way easier than trying to make vagrants multimachine run work. Simply placing the files in diferent folders seems to work fine enough.
Vagrant seems to be a bit unstable for hosting the chef server. I can't be certain but it seems that sometimes vagrant dosen't close properly which causes bizarre errors when trying to use the server. These erors have always disappeared upon a fresh install.
