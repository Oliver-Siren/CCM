Avahi daemon could maybe be used to provide a way to use fqdn addresses for the configuration of Chef domain. The problem in trying this out for me was that vagrant dosen't have avahi by default and each instance of vagrant gets the same name. I'm also somewhat unsure of teh details of how avahi works as i uderstand it each machine needing a .local address needs to run the avahi-daemon.
